### Vision

It's hard to be purely objective when choosing your rpe. There can be emotional factors, distractions, etc. and it would be better if we could be more certain about what to use. I want to build a mobile app where, over time, the app will get better and better at predicting what your next top set should be to hit your desired rpe and rep range based on your last warm up.
